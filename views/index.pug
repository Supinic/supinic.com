						What are your projects?
					h6
						| I work on my chat bot&nbsp;
						a(href="//github.com/Supinic/supibot") Supibot
						| &nbsp;and&nbsp;
						a(href="//github.com/Supinic/supinic.com") this website
						| . Also, more smaller projects and modules connected to these.
					h6
						| The challenge I self-imposed is that every major project is being run on a Raspberry Pi 3B.

						How do I get Supibot in my (insert platform here) channel?

						| &nbsp;and read the reference on where to go next, based on your platform.

						Do you stream anywhere?
					h6
						| I usually stream programming and games on Twitch. Check it out&nbsp;
